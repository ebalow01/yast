‚Ä¢ Early sell on Thursday if RSI > 85 (never triggered in our data)

DOUBLE-DOWN DECISION (Thursday after buy):
‚Ä¢ If price drops below Monday buy price AND RSI < 35
‚Ä¢ Buy additional position at Thursday closing price
‚Ä¢ Average cost basis for return calculation

======================================================================
üìÖ EXECUTION TIMELINE:
======================================================================

MONTHLY CYCLE:
1. Last Monday: Check RSI at market close
   - If RSI < 60: BUY at closing price
   - If RSI > 80: SKIP this month

2. Thursday (if position taken): Check for double-down
   - If price < buy price AND RSI < 35: BUY MORE
   - Otherwise: Hold position

3. First Monday (next month): SELL
   - Sell at opening price
   - Calculate return and reinvest

======================================================================
üîç RSI CALCULATION DETAILS:
======================================================================
‚Ä¢ Period: 14 days
‚Ä¢ Method: Wilder's Smoothing
‚Ä¢ Based on: Daily closing prices
‚Ä¢ Range: 0-100 (30 = oversold, 70 = overbought)
‚Ä¢ Our thresholds: 35 = extreme oversold, 60 = neutral, 80 = overbought

======================================================================

======================================================================
‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT NOTES:
======================================================================
‚Ä¢ Never sell early based on high RSI (DRIP trends don't reverse quickly)
‚Ä¢ Double-down feature triggered 3 times in 5 years (rare but effective)
‚Ä¢ Skip months when RSI > 80 (avoids buying at peaks)
‚Ä¢ RSI < 60 threshold catches most opportunities without excessive risk

======================================================================
üíª IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
======================================================================
‚Ä¢ 14-day RSI calculation on daily DRIP closing prices
‚Ä¢ Monday/Thursday/Monday trading schedule
‚Ä¢ Position sizing: $100k base, double to $200k if double-down triggers
‚Ä¢ Broker with good fill quality at market open/close
‚Ä¢ Disciplined execution (no emotional overrides)

======================================================================
üéØ WHY THIS STRATEGY WORKS:
======================================================================
1. DRIP has strong "beginning-of-month" effect (63.6% of highs in days 1-10)
2. RSI filtering avoids buying at momentum peaks
3. Double-down feature capitalizes on extreme oversold conditions  
4. Monthly frequency reduces transaction costs and noise
5. 5-year track record proves consistency across different market cycles
