==================================================
📊 RISK MANAGEMENT & FILTERING
==================================================

RSI (RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX) EXPLAINED:
• RSI is a momentum oscillator ranging from 0-100
• RSI > 70 = Generally overbought (potential sell signal)
• RSI < 30 = Generally oversold (potential buy signal)
• RSI 30-70 = Neutral zone
• We use 14-day RSI with Wilder's smoothing method

RSI FILTERING STRATEGIES DEFINED:

1. "RSI FILTER" STRATEGY:
   • RULE: Only buy when RSI ≤ 70
   • LOGIC: Avoid buying when stock is overbought
   • BENEFIT: Reduces risk of buying at local peaks
   • TRADE-OFF: May miss some momentum trades

2. "RELAXED RSI" STRATEGY:
   • RULE: Buy when RSI is between 20-80
   • FOCUS: Prefer entries when RSI < 60 
   • SKIP: Only when extremely overbought (RSI > 80)
   • LOGIC: More permissive than strict RSI filter
   • BENEFIT: Captures more trades while avoiding extreme overbought

3. "DOUBLE DOWN" ENHANCEMENT:
   • RULE: Double position size when RSI < 30 (oversold)
   • LOGIC: Oversold conditions often present better risk/reward
   • RISK: Higher concentration but potentially higher returns

CURRENT PIPELINE RSI RULES:
• Skip trades when RSI > 80 (extremely overbought)
• Prefer entries when RSI < 60 for optimal risk/reward
• Monitor RSI on buy date for each ticker

POSITION SIZING:
• Use 100% of available capital for each trade
• Compound all gains into next trade
• No leverage or margin

STOP LOSS:
• No hard stop losses implemented
• Hold through full cycle (Monday to Monday)
• Strategy relies on statistical edge over time
