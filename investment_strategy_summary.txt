===============================
Generated: August 15, 2025

OVERVIEW
--------
The YAST (Yet Another Stock Tracker) system implements a sophisticated weekly distribution ETF portfolio strategy focused on high-income generation through algorithmic trading and dividend capture techniques.

CORE STRATEGY PHILOSOPHY
------------------------
• Focus on weekly distribution ETFs that pay dividends every week
• Combine systematic dividend capture with buy-and-hold strategies
• Risk-balanced approach using 45-day volatility metrics
• Automated portfolio optimization with strict risk constraints

PRIMARY INVESTMENT TARGETS
--------------------------
Weekly distribution ETFs specializing in:
- YieldMax options income strategies (YMAX, YMAG, ULTY, etc.)
- Covered call ETFs (QDTE, XDTE, WDTE, etc.)
- Sector-specific high-yield ETFs (NVDW, TSLW, CHPY, etc.)
- Alternative income ETFs (YBTC, YETH, XBTY for crypto exposure)

PORTFOLIO SELECTION CRITERIA
----------------------------

Rule 1 - Mandatory Inclusion:
• ETFs with >40% returns AND <40% 45-day volatility
• These automatically qualify for portfolio inclusion

Rule 2 - Dividend Capture Focus:
• ETFs with >30% dividend capture returns AND <80% 45-day volatility
• Included unless better alternatives exist on same ex-dividend day

Risk Management:
• Maximum portfolio risk: 15% (45-day volatility constraint)
• Individual asset risk cap: 80% for Rule 2 ETFs
• Diversification across different ex-dividend days

TRADING STRATEGIES
------------------

1. Buy & Hold (B&H):
   - Traditional approach: buy ETF and hold for entire period
   - Collect all dividends and capital appreciation
   - Preferred for stable, consistently performing ETFs

2. Dividend Capture (DC):
   - Strategic trading around ex-dividend dates
   - Enter positions before ex-dividend, exit shortly after
   - Minimizes market exposure while capturing dividend income
   - Higher win rates (often 80-95%) but more complex execution

3. Enhanced Strategies:
   - DD to DD+4: Hold from dividend declaration to 4 days post ex-div
   - DD+2 to DD+4: Shorter holding period for volatile ETFs
