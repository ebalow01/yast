Risk and Return Calculation Methodology Analysis
=================================================================

RISK CALCULATION:
- Risk = Volatility (Standard Deviation of Daily Returns)
- Calculated using: daily_returns.std() * sqrt(252) * 100
- Annualized volatility in percentage
- Example: PLTW = 90.6% (very volatile), YMAX = 26.5% (moderate)

RETURN CALCULATION:
- Two strategies compared: Buy & Hold vs Dividend Capture
- Buy & Hold: ((end_price + total_dividends) / start_price - 1) * 100
- Dividend Capture: Active strategy results from trading around ex-div dates
- Final 'return' field uses the BETTER performing strategy
- 'bestStrategy' field indicates which strategy performed better

MEDIAN DIVIDEND CALCULATION:
- Median of ALL historical dividend payments
- Calculated from {ticker}_dividends.csv files
- Filters out zero dividends: dividends = dividends[dividends > 0]
- Uses pandas median() function: dividends.median()

FORWARD YIELD CALCULATION (NEW):
- Forward Yield = (median of last 3 dividends * 52) / current_price * 100
- Uses most recent 3 dividend payments for recency
- Annualizes by multiplying by 52 (weeks)
- Results range from 17.0% (SDTY) to 80.8% (HOOW)
- Average forward yield: 47.6%, Median: 44.5%

CALCULATION EXAMPLES:
- HOOW: 80.8% = (1.075 * 52) / $69.19 * 100
- YMAX: 50.4% = (0.135 * 52) / $13.93 * 100  
- SDTY: 17.0% = (0.148 * 52) / $45.34 * 100

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Risk is measured as annualized volatility (higher = more risky)
2. Returns use the best strategy between buy-hold and dividend capture
3. Forward yield predicts future income based on recent dividend patterns
4. High forward yields often correlate with higher volatility/risk
